LaTeX is a **document preparation system** for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large **technical** or **scientific** documents but it can be used for almost any from of publishing.

LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the apprearance of their documents but not concertrante on getting the right content.

**What it is**, not **How it looks**.
